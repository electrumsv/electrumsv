# - Unable to get the prefix wildcard to work in the trigger branch include list, e.g. 'release-*' or 'release*' is invalid.
#   - Microsoft appear to force a branch naming based on '/', e.g. 'release/*' okay, 'release-*' not okay.
#   - This means that as we make new major level releases we will have to manually add those branches (or adopt Microsoft's policy).
# - 'failOnStdErr' flags unimportant things that are written to stderr, so cannot easily be enabled.
#   - This means that if one command fails it will proceed onto the next and fail that.
# - The Wine build docker image is specified by hash, with the intent that it ensures that what we get is what we uploaded to Docker Hub.
#   - Also tying it to the hash, ensures historical reproducibility and failure will be indicated by Docker image availability.
# - MacOS build errors in Calin's QR reader.
