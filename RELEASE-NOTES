ElectrumSV is a fork of the open source Electrum Bitcoin wallet (www.electrum.org) for
Bitcoin SV.  It continues on from the Electron Cash fork from the Electrum 2.9.0 codebase,
which continues to work with Bitcoin Cash, which like Bitcoin Core retains the Bitcoin
name while no longer following the Bitcoin design from the whitepaper.  Bitcoin SV is the
only real Bitcoin following the whitepaper.

The ElectrumSV software is NOT affiliated, associated, or endorsed by Electrum,
electrum.org or the Electrum developers.  Likeswise neither with Electron Cash.

If you are concerned about running ElectrumSV binaries you can always install and/or run
it from the Github source directly.  However, all binaries are GPG signed, and SHA256
hashes are provided, with both hashes and signatures being checked into the Github
repository -- published through separate means and on separate web sites from the
binaries.  The Windows builds are also created deterministically and it should be possible
for users to verify that the source they should have been created from, is exactly the
source they were created from.  So, there are several tools in a users hands that allow
them to ascertain they can trust the builds and binaries provided.


Usage
-----

When you first run ElectrumSV it will use a different configuration directory to Electrum
or Electron Cash.  On Unix it is "~/.electrum-sv", and on Windows/MacOS it is "ElectrumSV".
The first time you run ElectrumSV, you will be given the option of copying your wallets
from Electron Cash.  Initially transactions will show up as unverified because ElectrumSV
is downloading the blockchain headers to verify the transactions.  This can take a few
minutes, but is only done once.

Ensure you are running ElectrumSV and not Electrum or Electron Cash by checking for
"ElectrumSV" in the title bar wording.

We STRONGLY recommend you get comfortable and only send a small amount of Bitcoin SV coins
at first, to yourself, to confirm the network is processing your transactions as expected.

# Release 1.2.0 (pending)
  * NOTE: this is beta software; please ensure it works properly for you with small amounts
    before using large ones.
  * Rewrite of the networking code to use asynchronous logic. This allows the code to
    be written in a clearer and more straightforward fashion, and both helps us ensure that it
    works correctly and reduces the chance of bugs.
  * Rewrite of the SPV support functionality to work with the new asynchronous networking.
    This includes both the synchronisation of address usage in blockchain transactions and
    verification that located transactions are real and were included in blocks using merkle
    proofs.
  * Correctly set the application icon so that it is displayed for all windows. This is possibly
    irrelevant on some operating systems, but on Windows it ensures that the application icon
    featured in the top left-hand corner of the window is not blandly undefined but rather the
    glorious new icon that we have.
  * Switch to cointype 0 (Bitcoin) for BIP44-derivations by default.  145 (BCH) and 236 (BSV)
    might need to be tried when restoring a wallet.
  * Several cleanups and improvements to internals that increase robustness and stability.
  * KeepKey users: you must upgrade to a recent firmware (6.0.4 is recommended)

# Release 1.1.2
  * When run in portable mode, ElectrumSV would fail to correctly locate the Electron Cash
    wallets directory, and would show the portable mode ElectrumSV wallets as the Electron Cash
    wallets. The Electron Cash portable mode wallet directory is now correctly located.

# Release 1.1.1
  * Do not display raw errors from the server when the user uses the 'Tools / Load Transaction /
    From the blockchain' menu. They are now presented in a way where it is highlighted that
    the actual message can be maliciously replaced by the server, and the user needs to use their
    own good judgement to determine whether the error message is relevant or correct.
  * Added a popup help dialog for the 'Existing Electron Cash wallets detected' message, shown
    on the wallet selection page of the wizard.
  * Added a popup help dialog for the 'I already have a seed' page, shown during the wallet
    creation process in the wizard. This goes into detail about the repercussions of importing
    seeds created in Centbee, Handcash or Moneybutton/Yours, where that seed is still being
    used in those wallets. The gist is that it is not supported, and you're best to check with
    those wallets before doing it.
  * Added a popup dialog confirming how many Electron Cash wallets were imported by the user,
    which will give the user feedback that something actually happened.
  * Include the new logos and icons kindly provided by the Bitcoin Association. Thanks again to
    MrScatman (https://twitter.com/bsmith12251960) for the original icon.
  * Fix a bug where importing or sweeping a private key would error
    (https://github.com/electrumsv/electrumsv/issues/45).
  * Fix a bug in encrypting messages where the user entered a bad public key
    (https://github.com/electrumsv/electrumsv/issues/46).

# Release 1.1.0
  * Check for updated versions on startup, and indicates updates in the wallet UI.
  * Various hardware wallet fixes.  Note hardware wallets may display Bitcoin Cash
    addresses instead of Bitcoin addresses; this is out of our control and pending
    firmware updates.  For similar reasons they may also warn about addresses being
    incorrect for the coin type; these warnings may be ignored.
  * New blockchain parsing and fork handling code, replacing the historically unstable code.
  * Tentative support for file attachments in OP_RETURN pushdatas when sending a transaction.
  * Support for new ?sv style urls, which are also used in QR codes.
  * Console tab improvements and warning.
  * Addition of a preliminary log viewer.
  * Address converter tab removed.  ElectrumSV still accepts Bitcoin Cash "cashaddr"
    addresses but only displays Bitcoin addresses.  A future release will remove support for
    cashaddr entirely.
  * Removal of all plugins.  Two plugins become extensions: cosigner pool, and labelsync.
    Audio modem support has been removed.  Virtual keyboard support is now in all password
    fields.
  * Testnet: testnet now uses the correct tpub, tprv derivations and not mainnet's xpub, xprv
    derivations.
  * Many fixes and internals improvements.

# Release 1.0.0
  * Coin splitting support.
  * Checkpoints locking the blockchain to the Bitcoin SV fork.
  * Bitcoin SV related block explorers.
  * Bitcoin SV related exchange rate services.
