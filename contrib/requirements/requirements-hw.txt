# 2023-05-01 RT: tried 0.13.5 but the API has changed and it errors on passed callback values.

# Keepkey uses an unpinned protobuf version, but has older definitions. We need to pin protobuf to
# a compatible version to work without issue.
# - Protobuf 3.18.0 was used in 1.3.15 but Github noisily triggers dependabot alerts everytime
#   we push code referring to this. Our use of protobuf is limited to Keepkey, and not externally
#   accessible, so it's not really an issue but it is costing work to fend off these alerts.
# - Protobuf 3.18.3 is recommended by Github. But it core dumps on MacOS in our unit tests and
#   this is an indicator of instability at least on MacOS.
# - Protobuf 3.19.6 is the last release before 3.20, which is where the API seems to have broken.
#   It does not core dump on MacOS and testing including signing on Windows does not trigger the
#   broken API path.
# protobuf==3.20.1  # Protobuf 4.0 errors and tells us to pin to 3.20 (required by at least Keepkey).
# 2023-04-26 RT: Reverted to old reliable 3.18.0 as 3.20.0-3.20.3 produce corrupt values in the
#   win32 pyinstaller builds. But they worked fine in win64 running from source.
protobuf==3.18.0
