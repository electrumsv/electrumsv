<h2>The Blockchain scanner window</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Provisional in-wallet help</i></p>
<p>
This window allows the user to search the blockchain for activity relating to their currently
selected account. Once activity has been located, the user can opt to import any located
transactions into the given account. It is only recommended that users do this if they have to,
and not just out of idle curiosity as it comes with both risks and limitations.
</p>
<h3>When blockchain scanning is allowed</h3>
<h4>Creating a new account</h4>
<p>
When a user creates a new account by importing pre-existing key information, whether done through
the importing an account from text or hardware wallet options, they will be presented with the
option to scan the blockchain for activity. The account will actually be locked until they have
performed this scan. Visible indications will be provided that accounts in this state are unusable,
and helpful direction provided to aid the user in performing the required scan.
</p>
<h4>When the user chooses</h4>
<p>
Users will be able to opt to rescan an account at a later date, should they have the need to do so.
Most users will never have a need to do this, and will only find tainted transactions by doing so.
</p>
<h3>Valid use</h3>
<p>
The sole valid use for scanning the blockchain is worst case scenario recovery of key usage.
This is not ideal, but it is the sole resource that users have available to them in this situation.
</p>
<h3>Stages of blockchain scanning</h3>
<h4>Transaction discovery</h4>
<p>
The first stage is searching for use of the current account's keys on the blockchain. This will
show progress in the form of noting how many transactions have been found and how long has been
spent looking. When all keys have been searched, the scanner will have a record of where they
were used ready for the import stage.
</p>
<h5>Limitations</h5>
<p>
The blockchain scanning functionality is not intended to fix any conflicts that may exist.
If scanning locates any conflicting transactions, the import process will be disabled. This should
not occur, and if it does occur it is possibly because of unexpected circumstances.
</p>
<h5>Advanced options</h5>
<p>
Only deterministic accounts have advanced options at this time. Imported address, public key and
private key accounts do not, and the button will be disabled.
</p>
<h4>Transaction import</h4>
<p>
The second stage is importing the transactions that were found to be using the account's keys.
While this can be interrupted at any stage, that will only stop additional transactions from being
imported. It will not remove transactions that have already been imported, those transactions
should be disassociated from the account manually.
</p>
<h3>Possible dangers</h3>
<h4>Data loss</h4>
<p>
The blockchain information which enables keys to be linked to transactions that may have been
published to it, is very limited. All it locates is the raw transactions. No context, no metadata.
This is as stated, a worst case scenario approach to recovery of account contents. Any information
the previous wallet had on the transactions and the accounts it includes in general, cannot be
recovered at this time.
</p>
<h4>Tainted transactions</h4>
<p>
A user should only accept payments that they know the source of. The danger with including
mystery transactions found on the blockchain into the user's account, is that these transactions
may be tainted in one of several possible ways.
<ul>
    <li>They may have been sent to the user with the goal of tracking any payments or blockchain
        interactions the user makes, when the user claims the funds and spends them.</li>
    <li>Deranged users are known to post illegal material to the blockchain so that they can
        claim that the blockchain or the users who receive it are complicit.</li>
</ul>
For these reasons it is strongly recommended that users be very careful about which payments
they incorporate into their account.
