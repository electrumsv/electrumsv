<h2>Blockchain scanner - Advanced options</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Provisional in-wallet help</i></p>
<p>
The options shown in this dialog window will depend on the type of account the scan is being
performed for.
</p>
<h3>Deterministic accounts</h3>
<p>
An account is classified as "deterministic" if it has the ability to generate new keys on demand.
Accounts which are not deterministic, are generally only those with directly imported public keys,
private keys and addresses.
</p>
<h4>Detecting when to stop searching</h4>
<p>
Certain types of accounts have the ability to create new keys on demand. If the wallet software is
scanning the blockchain looking for transactions that use the keys in an account, it can look at
known approaches to creating a sequence of keys and keep looking at those sequences until it stops
finding used keys along them. The way it works out if there are no more keys, is if it reaches a
point in the sequence of keys where there are a given number of unused keys in a row. The technical
term for this sequence of unused keys, is the "gap limit."
</p>
<p>
This section allows the gap limit to be set for the different key sequences. Changing the gap
limit is not recommended unless it is known that something has gone wrong in the past with the
key sequences causing unexpected gaps to occur. Servers can rate limit the free access they give
to the services the scanner uses, and in the future may charge for more than a small amount of free
daily usage.

<h5>Change</h5>
<p>
When a user is paying someone else, the coins from their account that they pay with rarely add up
to exactly the amount they are paying. The left over balance is sent back to the account the funds
come from. This change from the payment is placed in payment destinations using keys from a
specific sequence of keys, the change keys. This is the same concept as the change that is made
when physical notes and coins are used for payment.
</p>
<h5>Received funds</h5>
<p>
When a user is planning on receiving funds, they select a payment destination it should go to and
give it to the payer. These payment destinations are created including keys from a specific
sequence of keys, the receiving keys.
