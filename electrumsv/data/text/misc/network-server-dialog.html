<h2>Network server dialog</h2>

This dialog is used to both add new servers and to edit existing servers.

<h3>Wallets and server portability</h3>
<p>
ElectrumSV can have multiple wallets loaded at a time, but only if the user explicitly loads each
one. In the event a user has added a server for all wallets, and they copy their wallet file to
another machine, the ElectrumSV running on that machine will not know about the server.
</p>
<p>
If the user wants the server to be attached to the wallet and to be available on the new
ElectrumSV installation, they need to set it up to do that in the access section.
