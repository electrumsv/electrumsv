<h2>The Expected payment dialog</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Provisional in-wallet help</i></p>
<p>
    The Expected payment dialog is used to create, view and edit expected payments for the
    selected account. An expected payment declares to the wallet that the user expects to
    receive an incoming payment at some point. This is useful to keep track of those payments,
    match them to transactions obtained in some way.
</p>

<h3>Payment type: online invoice</h3>
<p>
    This is the recommended way to receive payments. The user makes use of an invoicing service
    to generate and host their payment. They then give the link to their invoice on the invoicing
    server, and the service notifies them when a payment is made.
</p>
<h4>Sharing by copying the payment link</h4>
<p>
    When the service has accepted hosting the invoice for you, the "Copy payment link" will be
    enabled and clicking on it will copy the invoice link to the clipboard. Give it to the party
    who will be paying you, and they can open it in their wallet and have the process of paying
    you streamlined.
</p>
<h4>Sharing by copying the payment destination</h4>
<p>
    This is not supported for invoices. There will be no way to detect any payment they make.
</p>
<h4>Sharing by scanning the QR code</h4>
<p>
    The QR code encodes the payment link, and using a device that can scan the QR code, it is
    expected that the device can process that link. It should be scanned by the party that will
    make the payment. If the wallet owner wishes to give out the link to another party who is
    not present to scan the QR code, they should use the "Copy payment link" button instead.
</p>

<h3>Payment type: monitoring the blockchain</h3>
<p>
    This is the way that payments were done in the past. The user may have to pay a service to
    watch for new transactions in order to detect and obtain them. It has a risk in that if the
    user gives out the payment destination and they have not paid the service, it may become much
    more expensive to find payment transactions which the service did not know to watch for.
</p>
<h4>Sharing by copying the payment link</h4>
<p>
    This button copies a <cite>bitcoin:</cite> style link. This link includes all the relevant
    details including the description, and the BSV amount. This is a BIP21 style link.
</p>
<h4>Sharing by copying the payment destination</h4>
<p>
    This can either be done by selecting the text in the <cite>Payment destination</cite> field
    and copying it the same way you would with any other selected text, or you can click the
    copy button on the right hand side of the field. This copies the shown payment destination
    whether it is an address or a BIP276-encoded script in the case of accounts that cannot use
    addresses.
</p>
<h4>Sharing by scanning the QR code</h4>
<p>
    The QR code encodes the payment link, and using a device that can scan the QR code, it is
    expected that the device can process that link. It should be scanned by the party that will
    make the payment.
</p>

<h3>Payment type: transaction import</h3>
<p>
    This is safer than monitoring the blockchain for a payment. The user knows that they can
    obtain either the transaction id or the transaction itself, from the party that is going to
    pay them. This might be an exchange, or some other kind of business, that has outdated tools
    and pays through the blockchain.
</p>
<p>
    The user can either import the transaction data if they have it, or give the transaction id
    to the wallet, and wallet can try and obtain the transaction. This will also attempt to get
    the important related data for the transaction, like proofs that it was mined in a given
    block.

</p>

<h3>Payment fields</h3>
<h4>Account</h4>
<p>
    In order to make it clear which account the payment will be credited to, we show the account
    name here.
</p>
<h4>Payment destination</h4>
<p>
    This is the unique payment destination for the given payment. If the account is the type that
    uses addresses this will be shown as an address, otherwise it will be shown as a
    BIP276-encoded script.
</p>
<p>
    However, for invoices this will not be shown at all. Users should use the "Copy payment link"
    button or QR code to give out the payment URL for the invoice.
</p>
<h4>Description (required)</h4>
<p>
    The <cite>Description</cite> field describes the expected payment so that the user can
    distinguish it from any of their other payments. When the payment transaction is imported
    it will be shown in the transaction history and given this description automatically.
</p>
<h4>Requested amount (optional)</h4>
<p>
    The <cite>Requested amount</cite> field if empty, represents an incoming payment of unknown
    value or perhaps the user cannot be bothered to fill out a value. If a value is provided, then
    the expected payment will not be closed out until either sufficient payments are received to
    meet that value, or the expiry period has passed. Address reuse is considered to lower
    privacy, so it is recommended that anyone paying pay as one single transaction and not
    multiple, unless a separate expected payment is created for each transaction.
</p>
<p>
    If fiat is enabled for the wallet two fields will be shown here, both BSV and the selected fiat
    currency. If fiat is not enabled, then only the BSV field will be shown here.
</p>
<h4>Request expires</h4>
<p>
    This currently describes the expiry period of the payment. It cannot currently be edited.
