# TODO(Future directions)
# - Allow users to set long expiry durations so they do not have to re-enter their password.
# - When we have a funding account type where it can be set to pay for expenses for other accounts,
#   it makes more sense if the credentials are cached for the funding account and they are not
#   for the savings account.
# - Indefinite credentials should be reference counted and shared between credential using "owners"
#   so that any data associated with them can be shared between the owners (where applicable),
#   an example of this is server API keys where a server may have a last connection attempt
#   time and a last successful connection attempt time, and even a last fee quote time.
#   Really the credential could be used as an id to centralise common management of a resource.
#   Just hashing a credential value wouldn't be enough, as the user might reuse a password for
#   instance for different contexts, so maybe hashing b"ESV.api.key"+ unencrypted_bytes.
